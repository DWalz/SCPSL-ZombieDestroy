# SCPSL-ZombieDestroy

Zombies feeling underwhelming and having too little impact on games? They now can destroy
doors as a group - even those that usually have to be opened by keycards. This makes
experience as SCP 049-2 a little more exciting that rust running around and right-clicking.

Built on the EXILED framework for SCP: Secret Laboratory

Download the compiled `SCPSL-ZombieAcces.dll` in the [releases](https://github.com/DWalz/SCPSL-ZombieDestroy/releases) tab.
If you want to compile it yourself, download the source code and do so.


## Setup

Setup your EXILED-Server (either follow the installation guide on the EXILED repository or use the GUI Installer for Windows)

Open the `%appdata%` folder (UNIX: `~/.config`) and add the `SCPSL-ZombieDestroy.dll` into the `Plugins` folder.

Restart the server and have fun
